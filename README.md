##Interview me to learn more!

Thank you for viewing my project repository. 
You may be wondering, why is there no explanation to the code? 
Well, that is on purpose. 
I understand that a very crucial skill in Data Science is being able to communicate, more specifically, to be able to communicate code to an audience with a low to general understanding. 
Because of this, I want to open up the chance to have a simple conversation through an interview to showcase my interpersonal communication abilities. 
I could have easily copied the generic explanations given to me by the provider of this project, however, that would've accomplished nothing. 
Please give me a call and give me the opportunity to explain to you why I'm a great fit for the job!
